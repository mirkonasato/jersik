Jersik
======

Jersik, the Json-Encoded Remote Service Invocation Kit, is a toolkit for
developing schema-first JSON over HTTP services.

The typical usage scenario is

* Write your schema in Jersik IDL
* Generate code for your server
* Generate code for your client(s)

Jersik is still in early stage of development and not really in a usable state
yet.
